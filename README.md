# Medical Symptom Assistant(LLM):

Healthcare accessibility remains a challenge globally, with patients often struggling to understand their symptoms before seeking medical advice. Delays in diagnosis can lead to worsening conditions, increased healthcare costs, and strain on medical infrastructure. A Medical Symptom Assistant (MSA) aims to bridge this gap by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to provide preliminary symptom assessments and suggest possible conditions based on user inputs.

The landscape of AI-driven Medical Symptom Assistants (MSAs) includes various commercial and academic approaches. However, many existing solutions either suffer from low accuracy, lack personalized recommendations, or fail to provide interpretability. Our proposed solution aims to bridge these gaps using a robust machine learning approach that improves accuracy, transparency, and reliability.
